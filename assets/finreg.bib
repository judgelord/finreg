@article{Braun2018,
	abstract = {{The pre-crisis rise and post-crisis resilience of European repo and securitization markets represent political victories for the interests of large banks. To explain when and how finance wins, the literature emphasizes lobbying capacity (instrumental power) and the financial sector's central position in the economy (structural power). Increasingly, however, finance also enjoys infrastructural power, which stems from entanglements between specific financial markets and public-sector actors, such as treasuries and central banks, which govern by transacting in those markets. To demonstrate the analytical value of this perspective, the article traces how the European Central Bank (ECB), motivated by monetary policy considerations, has shaped post-crisis financial policymaking in the EU. It shows that the ECB has played a key part in fending off a financial transaction tax on repos and in shoring up and rebuilding the securitization market. With market-based forms of state agency on the rise, infrastructural entanglement and power shed new light on the politics of finance.}},

@article{Mendelson2011,
	abstract = {Agency notice-and-comment rulemaking has been widely claimed to strengthen public participation and the democratic nature of governmental decision making. These claims have intensified as agencies have gained greater discretion over economic and health, safety, and environmental rules, as websites and e-mail have facilitated increasingly high levels of public comment, and as commentators have criticized the adequacy of presidential and congressional oversight of agencies. Some attention has been given to the extent of public participation, but we should also consider what agencies do and ought to do with the often enormous numbers of public comments they receive. This Foreword represents an initial foray into that issue. Agencies typically focus only on the technical comments, largely dismissing public policy and values-focused comments, even when they arrive in large numbers. Because values issues are typically relevant to an agency's implementation of its broad statutory responsibilities, however, the article makes a preliminary case that more thorough consideration of value-laden public comment could potentially enhance both the quality and democratic legitimacy of agency decision making. At the very least, it is time for more systematic evaluation of how agencies treat the comments they get.},

@article{Volden2002,
	abstract = {Political economists have modeled attempts by politicians to form$\backslash$nand empower bureaucracies. Some of these models demonstrate that$\backslash$ndelegation is greater under unified government. Scholars might expect$\backslash$nthat discretion would thus decline under divided government. However,$\backslash$nlegislators who attempt to limit executive agency discretion under$\backslash$ndivided government face the threat or use of an executive veto. This$\backslash$narticle expands previous formal models of discretion to include status$\backslash$nquo policies and levels of discretion, various agency preferences,$\backslash$nand the possibility of an executive veto, in order to determine the$\backslash$nlevel of bureaucratic discretion chosen in a separation of powers$\backslash$nsystem. Three main findings emerge: (1) given certain status quo$\backslash$nconditions and preference arrangements, discretion can be increased$\backslash$nor decreased under either divided or unified government; (2) executive$\backslash$nagencies are more likely to receive discretion under unified government,$\backslash$nbut independent agencies are more likely to receive discretion under$\backslash$ndivided government; and (3) there exists an asymmetry between politicians'$\backslash$nability to expand bureaucratic discretion and their ability to restrict$\backslash$ndiscretion.},

@article{Dwidar2021PSJ,
	abstract = {Many studies have identified a line of influence between interest group lobbying and the federal bureaucracy's implementation of public policy. These works, however, have often focused on the influence of individual groups rather than coalitional efforts, which compose the majority of lobbying. Assessing this activity is critical to understanding the role of public participants in administrative policymaking. I test the influence of diverse coalitions of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs by analyzing a new dataset of organizations' co-signed public comments across nearly 350 federal agency rules proposed between 2005 and 2015. I find that agencies favor recommendations from organizationally diverse coalitions, and not coalitions that are bipartisan or dominated by business interests. Further, I find that coalition influence is heightened when lobbying in coalitions that are larger in size and more well-resourced, and when policy salience is low. I conclude that diverse lobbying coalitions help bureaucrats to shape the direction and content of regulatory law. This conclusion further establishes the role of organizational participants in bureaucratic policymaking and contributes to the debate over democratic legitimacy in the administrative state.},

@article{Ziegler2016,
	abstract = { The financial crisis of 2008 raised the politics of regulation to a new level of practical and scholarly attention. We find that recent reforms in U.S. financial markets hinge on intellectual resources and new organizational actors that are missing from existing concepts of regulatory capture or business power. In particular, small advocacy groups have proven significantly more successful in opposing the financial services industry than existing theories predict. By maintaining the salience of reform goals, elaborating new analytic frameworks, and deploying specialized expertise in post-enactment debates, smaller organizations have contributed to a diffuse but often decisive network of pro-reform actors. Through the rule-writing process for macroprudential supervision and derivatives trading, these small organizations coalesced with other groups to form a new stability alliance that has so far prevented industry groups from dominating financial regulation to the degree that occurred in earlier cases of regulatory reform. },

@article{Lucca2014,
	abstract = {This paper traces career transitions of federal and state U.S. banking regulators from a large sample of publicly available curricula vitae, and provides basic facts on worker flows between the regulatory and private sector resulting from the revolving door. We find strong countercyclical net worker flows into regulatory jobs, driven largely by higher gross outflows into the private sector during booms. These worker flows are also driven by state-specific banking conditions as measured by local banks' profitability, asset quality and failure rates. The regulatory sector seems to experience a retention challenge over time, with shorter regulatory spells for workers, and especially those with higher education. Evidence from cross-state enforcement actions of regulators shows gross inflows into regulation and gross outflows from regulation are both higher during periods of intense enforcement, though gross outflows are significantly smaller in magnitude. These results appear inconsistent with a "quid-pro-quo" explanation of the revolving door, but consistent with a "regulatory schooling" hypothesis.},

	abstract = {This article assesses the influence of income inequality on the public's policy mood. Recent work has produced divergent perspectives on the relationship between inequality, public opinion, and government redistribution. One group of scholars suggests that unequal representation of different income groups reproduces inequality as politicians respond to the preferences of the rich. Another group of scholars pays relatively little attention to distributional outcomes but shows that government is generally just as responsive to the poor as to the rich. Utilizing theoretical insights from comparative political economy and time-series data from 1952 to 2006, supplemented with cross-sectional analysis where appropriate, we show that economic inequality is, in fact, self-reinforcing, but that this is fully consistent with the idea that government tends to respond equally to rich and poor in its policy enactments.},

@article{McCarty2017,
	abstract = {I develop a model of policy making in complex domains where bureaucrats find it very difficult to establish autonomous sources of expertise, so regulators are highly dependent on the regulated industry and its willingness to engage in self-regulation. In the model, a legislative principal decides whether to delegate the power to an agency to regulate the activities of a firm or industry. The policy domain is complex in that knowledge of the implications of different policy choices is concentrated in the firm. The agency can learn about the policy environment only through monitoring the firm's efforts at self-regulation. The main result is that, as policy becomes more complex, regulatory outcomes are increasingly biased toward those preferred by the firm. Moreover, when the agency has preferences that diverge from the firm's, the firm invests less in its own self-regulatory efforts for fear that its policy investments will be expropriated.},

@techreport{Copeland2008,
	abstract = {Electronic rulemaking, or "e-rulemaking," began in the federal government within individual agencies in the mid-to late 1990s, but current government-wide initiatives can be traced to both congressional and presidential sources. For example, the E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies, "to the extent practicable," to accept public comments on their rules electronically and to ensure that one or more federal websites contains those comments and other materials normally maintained in rulemaking dockets. E-rulemaking is also one of about two dozen e-government initiatives launched as part of the George W. Bush Administration's President's Management Agenda. In the first phase of the initiative, the Administration established a website through which the public can identify all federal rules that are open for comment and provide comments on those rules. The second phase involves the creation of a government-wide docket system that can allow the public to review rulemaking materials (e.g., agencies' legal and cost-benefit analyses for their rules) and the comments of others. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead agency for the e-rulemaking initiative. E-rulemaking has been described as a way to increase democratic legitimacy, improve regulatory policy decisions, decrease administrative costs, and increase regulatory compliance. However, the implementation of e-rulemaking in the federal government has been controversial. Although the migration of agencies into the government-wide docket was originally planned for 2004, that migration is currently not expected to be completed until 2008. Congress has objected to how e-rulemaking and several other e-government projects have been funded (through appropriations transfers or reimbursements to the projects' "managing partner" agencies), and has voiced other concerns about the overall management and appropriateness of the initiatives. Questions have also been raised regarding the e-rulemaking initiative's centralized structure, its costs (more than {\$}53 million spent through FY2008) and expected financial benefits, the functionality of some of the applications being used, and its effect on public participation in the rulemaking process. The reasons why the federal e-rulemaking initiative has had such a difficult first five years are many, but one appears to be the lack of direct, consistent funding. From FY2003 through FY2007, Congress appropriated less than {\$}20 million to the E-Government Fund for all e-government projects-much less than the {\$}345 million authorized in the E-Government Act for that period. Congress has also required approval by the Appropriations Committees before any transfers or reimbursements of appropriations are made. Although some have suggested that better communication is needed between Congress and the executive branch, the recent conflicts may reflect basic differences of opinion between the two branches regarding control of federal operations and how the branches should interact. A long-term issue is whether e-rulemaking should continue to be housed in EPA. This report will be updated as appropriate to reflect changes in the e-rulemaking initiative.},

	abstract = {Using a vast swath of data spanning the past six decades,Unequal Democracydebunks many myths about politics in contemporary America, using the widening gap between the rich and the poor to shed disturbing light on the workings of American democracy. Larry Bartels shows the gap between the rich and poor has increased greatly under Republican administrations and decreased slightly under Democrats, leaving America grossly unequal. This is not simply the result of economic forces, but the product of broad-reaching policy choices in a political system dominated by partisan ideologies and the interests of the wealthy.Bartels demonstrates that elected officials respond to the views of affluent constituents but ignore the views of poor people. He shows that Republican presidents in particular have consistently produced much less income growth for middle-class and working-poor families than for affluent families, greatly increasing inequality. He provides revealing case studies of key policy shifts contributing to inequality, including the massive Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 and the erosion of the minimum wage. Finally, he challenges conventional explanations for why many voters seem to vote against their own economic interests, contending that working-class voters have not been lured into the Republican camp by "values issues" like abortion and gay marriage, as commonly believed, but that Republican presidents have been remarkably successful in timing income growth to cater to short-sighted voters.Unequal Democracyis social science at its very best. It provides a deep and searching analysis of the political causes and consequences of America's growing income gap, and a sobering assessment of the capacity of the American political system to live up to its democratic ideals.},

@article{Skocpol2004,
	abstract = {Nearly a century ago, the American Political Science Association was launched at a December 1903 meeting held at Tulane University in New Orleans during the joint conventions of the American Economics Association and the American Historical Association.  That founding was the culmination of a year-long process of tapping the opinions of scholars and men of affairs interested -- as the original circular letter put it -- in ``the establishment of some representative body that can take the scientific lead in all matters of a political interest, encouraging research, aiding if possible in the collection and publication of valuable material and, in general advancing the scientific study of politics in the United States.''1   Did it make more sense -- asked the circular letter -- to organize special-interest sections within the AEA, the AHA and the American Social Science Association or to launch an independent national association?  Fortunately for us, prospective members overwhelmingly chose the latter course.  In New Orleans, they adopted a constitution and elected founding officers for the American Political Science Association, including Frank J. Goodnow of Columbia University as the first president.  Much has changed over the past century.  An Association that started with founding participants numbering in the dozens now boasts about 14,000 members.  An association once closely focused on the formal arrangements of law and government now encompasses a much broader understanding of politics; and presidential addresses over the decades document the emergence of behavioralism, systems theories, and rational choice to coexist with new variants of institutional analysis.  An association that originally functioned through ten scholarly and
 2governing committees now has 47 program divisions, 35 organized sections, 55 related groups, and 42 committees devoted to governance, awards, and representation. Each year, some 700 people, about one of every twenty members, participates in the voluntary leadership of the APSA and its sections. Last but not least, an association founded by white men now includes a rainbow of persons and is about to witness the first instance in which a woman president hands off the gavel to a female successor.       Despite the many changes over the decades, there have been important continuities -- so many that Frank Goodnow and his colleagues would surely recognize us today as understandable inheritors of the association and disciplinary vision they launched in 1903.  Now, as then, organized political science encompasses normative theory as well as empirical research.  Now, as then, the APSA features comparative research, area studies, and a focus on international politics as well as studies of American politics; and our membership is international.  The APSA fosters pedagogy as well as research.  We nurture ties to neighboring disciplines and proudly include scholars who started elsewhere in our ranks.  Now, as then, we aim to link responsible citizenship in the larger society to scholarly studies of government and politics.  In the words of Pendleton Herring delivered in his APSA presidential address fifty years ago, ``as we {\ldots} develop political science as a discipline we both serve our professional needs and perform the vital function of helping our democracy to know itself better.

Using data drawn from 388 individuals, I employ an innovative survey research design approach-anchoring vignettes-to measure political efficacy during rulemaking, as well as a randomized survey experiment to study causal drivers. Despite powerful arguments associated with low efficacy, participants report, on average, "a lot of say" during rulemaking. However, experimental evidence suggests that participants believe agencies are more responsive to business interests than to those of ordinary citizens. When taken together, these results imply notable efficacy among those who participate. However, this normatively optimistic finding is tempered by the normatively pessimistic perception that business interests hold a clear advantage over the general public in influencing agency policy decisions.},

@article{Yackee2012,
	abstract = {Scholars generally agree that interest groups are active and at times influential during the notice and comment period of regulatory policymaking (or "rulemaking"). But current research often ignores the agenda setting that may take place during the pre-proposal stage of rulemaking. During proposal development, interest groups may lobby to: (1) influence the content of proposed regulations or (2) block items from the regulatory agenda altogether. This article focuses on ex parte lobbying-"off the public record" conversations in which lobbyists share policy and political information with regulators-during the preproposal stage of rulemaking. I assess the importance of ex parte influence with data from a content analysis of government documents drawn from seven federal government agencies and a telephone survey of interested parties. Overall, the findings provide the first empirical confirmation that "off the record" lobbying can, and at times, does matter to regulatory content changes during a stage of the American policymaking process that is often overlooked by scholars and the public: the pre-proposal stage of agency rulemaking.},

	abstract = { Nearly half of all lobbying activity targeting specific bills between 1998 and 2012 happened after the Congress passed legislation, yet existing theories of lobbying generally fail to account for lobbying that occurs after a bill is passed. I argue that ex post lobbying aims to influence the distribution of particularistic benefits that will arise from legislation by targeting regulatory rule-making processes. I develop a model that describes lobbying as a collective action problem among interest groups, who must trade off between spending money to lobby for a bill's passage and spending money to lobby over the details of its implementation. The implications of the model suggest that bills with high proportions of particularistic provisions draw more ex post lobbying and that trade associations and larger firms bear a disproportionately large share of the ex ante lobbying burden. Empirical analysis of lobbying reports is consistent with these predictions. },

These lines of research, however, have often portrayed interest groups as actors with indirect influence (who, for example, work through or with Congress), rather than assessing the direct influence of interest groups on bureaucratic policy outputs. I conduct a test of direct interest group influence by analyzing an original data set composed of 1,444 interest group comments in reaction to forty federal agency rules. I find, contrary to the expectations of the extant literature, that the formal participation of interest groups during rulemaking can, and often does, alter the content of policy within the ``fourth branch'' of government. I conclude that those who voice their preferences during the notice and comment period rulemaking are often able to change government policy outputs to better match their preferences.},

@article{James2021,
	abstract = { AbstractRegulatory initiatives are frequently shaped by the ability of the financial industry to build alliances across the wider business community. Yet comparative and international political economy scholarship remains divided over how to explain the resulting networks of financial lobbying. Using quantitative text analysis of 1300 responses to EU financial regulatory consultations between 2010 and 2018, we map patterns of lobbying coordination based on cosigning and text re-use in consultation responses for the first time. This unique dataset is used to analyze hitherto hidden patterns of domestic and cross-border coordination by financial organizations within and between European countries. We find that while distinctive national lobbying networks persist at the country level, the internationalization of financial actors is statistically associated with the formation of coordination ties with foreign financial actors. This suggests that European financial integration has facilitated the emergence of new cross-border alliances which complement -- rather than substitute for -- existing domestic financial interest coalitions. We argue that the text-as-data approach employed here makes an important new contribution to scholarship on business power and the political economy of Europe. },

	abstract = { Administrative law scholars and governmental reformers argue
 that advances in information technology will greatly expand public
 participation in regulatory policymaking. They claim that e-
 rulemaking, or the application of new technology to administrative
 rulemaking, promises to transform a previously insulated process into
 one in which ordinary citizens regularly provide input With the
 federal government having implemented several e-rulemaking
 initiatives in recent years, we can now begin to assess whether such a
 transformation is in the works - or even on the horizon. This paper
 compares empirical observations on citizen participation in the past,
 before e-rulemaking, with more recent data on citizen participation
 after the introduction of various types of technological innovations.
 Contrary to prevailing predictions, empirical research shows that e-
 rulemaking makes little difference: citizen input remains typically
 sparse, notwithstanding the relative ease with which individuals can
 now learn about and comment on regulatory proposals. These
 findings indicate that the more significant barriers to citizen
 participation are cognitive and motivational Even with e-rulemaking,
 it takes a high level of technical sophistication to understand and
 comment on regulatory proceedings. Moreover, even though
 information technology lowers the absolute cost of submitting
 comments to regulatory agencies, it also dramatically decreases the
 costs of a wide variety of entertainment and },

	abstract = {All administrative processes contain points of entry for politics, and the U.S. president's use of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review government regulations is no exception. Specifically, OMB review can open up a pathway for interest groups to lobby for policy change. We theorize that interest group lobbying can be influential during OMB review, especially when there is consensus across groups. We use a selection model to test our argument with more than 1,500 regulations written by federal agencies that were subjected to OMB review. We find that lobbying is associated with change during OMB review. We also demonstrate that, when only business groups lobby, we are more likely to see rule change; however, the same is not true for public interest groups. We supplement these results with illustrative examples suggesting that interest groups can, at times, use OMB review to influence the content of legally binding government regulations.},

	abstract = {Although the growth of bureaucracy has accompanied modernization throughout the world, it has been especially unsettling for America's particular system of democracy. American government has adapted to the rise of the administrative state through three, often-conflicting, means of promoting accountability. It has sought to ensure desired qualities in agency decision making through participatory opportunities and standards of rationality that are enforced through the courts. And both the president and Congress have sought to monitor and shape agencies' actions in accordance with their own policy preferences. Each of these controls has received considerable attention, but there are few up-to-date discussions of all three. This book fills that void by providing a balanced overview of the institutional powers and resources associated with administrative due process and executive and legislative oversight at the federal level. 1.

The first section of the Article explores participation's value to agency governance. The second section of the Article presents three models of agency governance - expertocratic, pluralist, and civic republican - and discusses participation's importance to each model. The Article then posits a distinction between ordinary and constitutive agency decisionmaking, and explores how participation affects each for the three distinct models of agency governance. The implications of mass participation are explored in the context of citizen suit provisions to enforce environmental laws, the Environmental Impact Statement process under the National Environmental Policy Act, and sunshine laws which require meetings of multi-member agencies to be open to the public. The Article concludes by suggesting that mass participatory reforms to administrative law have adverse implications for the models of agency governance in various contexts, but are particularly deleterious for civic republican theories of administrative law. Thus, the Article suggests, de-emphasizing participation in administrative law theory and reforms may work to make agency governance more democratic.},

	abstract = {Scholars have avoided studying interest group influence because of the difficulty operationalising the concept. The research presented here introduces a new way of measuring lobbying success and lays out a model of its determinants. To understand why interest groups sometimes succeed and at other times fail, we must consider the institutional structure of the political system within which the advocates are operating; the characteristics of the issue at hand; and finally the characteristics of the interest group itself and their lobbying strategy. I test these factors with original data based on interviews with I49 advocates in Washington D.C. and Brussels active on a random sample of 47 policy issues. From the results, issue context emerges as a much more important determinant of lobbying success than institutional differences. The institutional differences that do emerge suggest that direct elections coupled with private campaign finance lead to winner-take-all outcomes biased in favour of wealthier business interests, while the lack of these institutional characteristics leads to more balanced policy compromises with more advocates achieving some of their policy goals.},

@book{Wilson1989,
	abstract = {Wilson examines bureaucratic efficiency and capacity, and attempts to explain the agendas bureaucracies set out to realize and the constraints that hamper their ability to execute effectively. He outlines three primary constraints (Chapter 7) on bur eaucratic behavior: (1) they lack a profit maximizing incentive, since they are legally precluded from distributing profits to their clients; (2) they are unable to dynamically allocate resources to areas of greatest need or even greatest success; and fina lly (3) bureaucratic agencies serve goals that are not of their own choosing. Importantly, many of these constraints are not the result of internal failure but are imposed from external actors like Congress. This ``red tape'' is motivated by a desire to prevent agency misbehavior. Wilson concludes that these constraints lead to overly complex procedures and institutional rules, an incentive structure that aligns more closely with minimizing constraint violation than effective outcomes, and a proliferation of middle management who are incentivized to be risk averse and shy from innovation. As such, the inefficiency many experience in their interactions with bureaucracy isn't necessarily a result of agencies eager to assume an ever-increasing number of functions ; rather it is often their need to adhere to specific policy prescriptions that leads to inefficiency. Bureaucracy is the classic study of the way American government agencies work and how they can be made to work better. Examining a wide range of bureaucracies, including the Army, the FBI, the FCC, and the Social Security Administration, James Q. Wilson provides the first comprehensive, in-depth analysis of what government agencies do, why they function as they do, and how they might become more responsible and effective.
